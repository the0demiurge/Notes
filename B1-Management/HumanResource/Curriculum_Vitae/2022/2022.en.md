## Working Experience

### COMPANY POSITION <span style="float:right;">TIME</span>

#### Intelligent Transportation System(ITS): Research on Applying Reinforcement Learning(RL) to Real World Production

- **S:** Intelligent control on traffic light signal timing could enhance traffic efficiency greatly. Current state-of-the-art AI traffic control algorithms are mainly based on strong assumption, which makes it hard to apply to real world product.
- **T:** ***1.*** Bring **RL** to real world production, and make it outperform traditional algorithms; ***2.*** Enhance RL training by **expert experience**; ***3.*** Research on **RL generalization** among several traffic scenarios.
- **A:** ***1.*** Design and develop a real-world compatible RL environment; ***2.*** Implement traditional algorithms as baseline; ***3.*** Fine tune RL algorithm and environment; ***4.*** Introduce **information entropy** to solve the problem of data imbalance, making RL agent learn expert experience and highly accelerating RL training. ***5.*** Design a RL model which generalizes to any shape of traffic intersection.
- **R:** Published: PRIVATE; another paper about RL generalization is under reviewing.

#### Vehicle to Everything(V2X): Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control(CACC)

- **S:** CACC is a crutial application in autopilot from levels of L2 to L4. For example, there is a [GLOSA](https://www.c-roads-germany.de/english/c-its-services/glosa/) defined at project C-ROADS(an EU project).
- **T:** Research and develop a CACC system to reduce energy consumption and improve driving comfort level.
- **A:** ***1.*** Implemented energy consuption models(HBEFA, SUMO/Energy, VT-CPFM)；***2.*** Recurrent GLOSA and Eco-CACC; ***3.*** Designed and developed a V2X-CACC by using **optimal control** to perform vehicle longitudinal **trajectory planning**, and decides whether to open CACC or not adaptively according to traffic situation.
- **R:** This project is working in progress. For now, the energy consumption is reduced 19% on the cost of 68% travel time increasement; while on 10% CAV penetration, the energy consumption is reduced 9% with fuel consumption increase 22%.

#### ITS: Urban Traffic Signal Control System

- **S:** Urban traffic signal control system adjusts traffic light timing to ensure vehicles and pedestrians move safely and efficiently.
- **T:** Design and develop large-scale traffic signal control algorithm modules, and utilize **machine learning** algorithoms to improve efficiency and reduce congestion reiably among several scenarios.
- **A:** ***1.*** Scheme selection: Use **clustering algorithm(DBSCAN & KMeans)** to group traffic data with different characteristics, and use **KNN** to learn the mappings from traffic characteristics to signal plans; ***2.*** Time-of-day division: divide time of a day by **sequence clustering algorithms(spectral clustering & Fisher)**; ***3.*** Traffic Optimization: based on the traffic flow model, solve single intersection and arterial by **Mixed-integer Linear Programming(MILP)** modeling, solve congestion optimization by **heuristic optimization** modeling; ***4.*** Reliability: embed traffic simulation tools(including SUMO) into the evaluation module with a fallback logic to shield poor signal plans.
